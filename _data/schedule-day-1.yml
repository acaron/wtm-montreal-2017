  title: "Diversity in Tech: Addressing the Pipeline and Creating the Culture"
  description: This talk aims to discuss the ways in which we can foster gender diversity in the tech industry. The pipeline to enter the industry is a visible theme when discussing the issue of women in tech. I intend to present this as well as open a discussion surrounding the current culture that prevents us from maintaining that potential diversity.
